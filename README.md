# Conversational-AI-System-for-Stock-Market-Intelligence
Market Insight is an AI-driven conversational platform that enables users to query real-time and historical stock market data using natural language. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), agentic reasoning, and tool-calling to provide accurate, grounded financial insights.

🚀 Overview

Market Insight combines Generative AI with structured financial data to support intelligent stock market research. By integrating LangChain, LangGraph, and OpenAI GPT models, the platform decomposes complex financial queries into executable steps and dynamically invokes specialized tools to retrieve and analyze data.

The system follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG-style) approach, grounding LLM responses in authoritative financial sources to improve factual accuracy and reliability.
